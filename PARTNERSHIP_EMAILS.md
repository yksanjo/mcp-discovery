# Priority Partnership Emails - Agent Tool Index

## 1. Anthropic (SEND FIRST - Warmest Lead)

**To:** developer-relations@anthropic.com, Alex Albert
**Subject:** MCP Discovery → Agent Tool Index - Partnership Proposal

---

Hi Anthropic team,

I'm Yoshi, Global Head of BD at Soundraw (AI music platform powering JPMorgan, Discord, Panasonic).

Yesterday I launched MCP Discovery - the semantic search layer for MCP servers. It's already:
- Live: https://mcp-discovery-production.up.railway.app
- 24 MCP servers indexed with embeddings
- PR submitted to your MCP registry

**But here's the bigger vision:**

I'm expanding this into the **Agent Tool Index** - a universal discovery layer for ANY tool agents need:
- MCP servers (done)
- REST/GraphQL APIs (50,000+ from APIs.guru, RapidAPI)
- Python packages
- Browser automation tools

**Why this matters for Anthropic:**

Claude agents are limited to pre-configured tools. With Agent Tool Index:
- Claude discovers tools automatically based on user intent
- Performance metrics help choose reliable options
- One API call returns ready-to-use integration code

**The ask:**

1. Strategic guidance on what Claude agents need most
2. Potential integration into Claude Desktop / MCP ecosystem
3. Co-marketing to Claude developers

I can be in SF anytime. Would love 30 minutes to explore.

Best,
Yoshi

## 2. Stripe

**To:** partnerships@stripe.com
**Subject:** Featured API Partner - Agent Tool Discovery Platform

---

Hi Stripe team,

I'm building the discovery layer for AI agent tools - think "the API directory that agents actually use."

**Why Stripe should care:**

Every agent that handles money needs Stripe. But right now, agents can't discover APIs - they're limited to what developers pre-configure.

My platform changes that:
- Agent asks: "I need to process payments"
- Returns: Stripe (98% match) + integration code + uptime metrics

**Current traction:**
- 24 MCP servers indexed (expanding to 50,000+ APIs)
- Live API with semantic search
- Submitted to Anthropic's MCP registry
- GitHub: https://github.com/yksanjo/mcp-discovery

**Partnership proposal:**

1. **Featured Listing** - Stripe as #1 result for payment queries
2. **Custom Templates** - Ready-to-use Stripe code for LangChain, LlamaIndex, raw Python
3. **Co-marketing** - Joint content for agent builders

**My background:** Global Head of BD at Soundraw (AI music for JPMorgan, Discord, Panasonic). I understand enterprise API partnerships.

Would love to discuss. Happy to share usage analytics once we scale.

Best,
Yoshi

## 3. Supabase

**To:** partnerships@supabase.com, @supabase DM
**Subject:** Agent Tool Discovery - Supabase as Default Database

---

Hey Supabase team,

Building something you might like: Agent Tool Index - semantic search for AI agent tools.

**Already using Supabase:**
- My platform runs on Supabase + pgvector
- Supabase is indexed as a top database recommendation
- When agents ask "I need a database with auth" → Supabase comes up first

**The vision:**
Expand from MCP servers to ALL APIs agents need. 50,000+ tools indexed.

**Partnership idea:**

1. Supabase as **featured database** for agent builders
2. Custom integration templates for agent frameworks
3. Case study: "How Agent Tool Index uses Supabase"

**Current state:**
- Live: https://mcp-discovery-production.up.railway.app
- GitHub: https://github.com/yksanjo/mcp-discovery
- Using your pgvector for semantic search

Agent builders are high-value customers - they scale fast. Let's make Supabase the default.

Best,
Yoshi

## 4. Twilio

**To:** partners@twilio.com
**Subject:** AI Agent Communication Layer - Partnership Opportunity

---

Hi Twilio team,

I'm building Agent Tool Index - the discovery layer for AI agent tools.

**The opportunity:**

Every agent that communicates with users needs Twilio (SMS, voice, email via SendGrid). But agents can't discover APIs automatically - yet.

My platform enables:
- Agent: "I need to send SMS notifications"
- Returns: Twilio (95% match) + ready-to-use code + pricing info

**Why partner:**

1. **New customer segment** - Agent builders are the fastest-growing API consumers
2. **Automatic discovery** - Agents recommend Twilio without manual configuration
3. **Integration templates** - Copy-paste code for every agent framework

**Current traction:**
- Live semantic search API
- Expanding to 50,000+ tools
- Enterprise background: Soundraw BD (JPMorgan, Discord, Panasonic)

**The ask:**
- Featured placement in communication category
- Co-marketing to agent developers
- Usage analytics sharing

Let's make Twilio the default communication layer for AI agents.

Best,
Yoshi

## 5. OpenAI

**To:** partnerships@openai.com
**Subject:** Tool Discovery for GPTs & Assistants API

---

Hi OpenAI team,

I built the discovery layer for AI agent tools - semantic search that helps agents find the right API for any task.

**The problem I'm solving:**

GPTs and Assistants are limited to pre-configured actions. There's no way to dynamically discover new tools based on user needs.

**My solution:**

Agent Tool Index - universal search across:
- 50,000+ REST/GraphQL APIs
- MCP servers (Anthropic's protocol)
- Python packages
- Browser automation tools

**How it works:**
```
User: "Help me send an invoice"
Agent calls: discover_tools({ need: "invoicing" })
Returns: Stripe Invoicing, QuickBooks, FreshBooks + integration code
```

**Why this matters for OpenAI:**

1. **GPT Store v2** - Tools could auto-discover capabilities
2. **Assistants API** - Dynamic tool selection based on conversation
3. **Plugins replacement** - Structured tool discovery

**Current traction:**
- Live API: https://mcp-discovery-production.up.railway.app
- Semantic search with embeddings (using your text-embedding-3-small)
- Growing developer adoption

**My background:** Global Head of BD at Soundraw, working with JPMorgan, Discord, Panasonic on AI integration.

Would love to discuss how this could enhance the OpenAI ecosystem.

Best,
Yoshi
